				<h2>What is Stardust?</h2>
				<p>Stardust is a language born out of frustration with other languages. After falling into the black holes of other languages for years, Stardust was finally born.</p>
				<h2>Status: WIP.</h2>
				<p>Currently, things are still in very early development; the syntax and goals of the language are still in flux. The GitHub issue tracker is being used like sticky notes - they'll be your best bet for understanding the direction the language is going.</p>
				<h2>Didn't this used to be called Cosmos?</h2>
				<p>Yes, but months after the name Cosmos had been decided on, someone else started a language also called Cosmos. Since their language was more developed, they kept the name.</p>
