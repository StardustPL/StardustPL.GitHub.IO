			<h1>The PolyStatic Programming Language</h1>

			<h2>What makes PolyStatic different?</h2>
			<p>PolyStatic is targeted at static typesafety and runtime modularity. The goal is to have a type system similar to those of C++ and Java, but runtime compatibility like that of Python. The intended use is programming game logic.</p>

			<h2>How do I learn to write PolyStatic code?</h2>
			<p>The documentation isn't read yet because the language is still very new. There are examples, though.</p>

			<h2>How do I compile/run it?</h2>
			<p>You have to use the interpreter for now, more options will be available later (such as compiling and running live from existing expplications).</p>

			<h2>What's the Hello World program?</h2>
			<p>For there to be a Hello World program, there has to be a way to output information somwhere. PolyStatic is meant to be used by other code (e.g. a game), so it depends on the caling code to provide e.g. a debugging callback function.</p>
