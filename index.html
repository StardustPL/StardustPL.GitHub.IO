			<li><strong>Liquid</strong>: Source code in raw form. The file extension is .cliquid</li>
			<li><strong>Gas</strong>: Declarations-only file, similar to C++ headers. The file extension is .cgas</li>
			<li><strong>Fluid</strong>: Fluids are liquids and gasses, which which make up a program.</li>
			<li><strong>Solidification</strong>: Compilation of liquids into solids</li>
			<li><strong>Sublimation</strong>: Creating a gas from a solid.</li>
			<li><strong>Liquefy</strong>: To execute a program.</li>
			<li><strong>Condensation</strong>: Implementing a gas in a liquid.</li>
